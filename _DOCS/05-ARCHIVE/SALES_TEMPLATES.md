I've built an AI agent that handles this automatically, 24/7. It's already saving my clients 15+ hours per week.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min demo this week?

No slides, just show you the system live.

Best,
[Your Name]

### 4. Closing Template (Handle Objections)

**Subject**: Re: Proposal - Quick clarification

**Objection: "Too expensive"**

```
I totally understand the concern about price.

Let me reframe it:

Cost per month: $299
Time saved: 20 hours
Your team's hourly rate: $25/hour

Actual value: $500/month
Your cost: $299/month
Net gain: $201/month (or $2,412/year)

Plus, you're not hiring someone at $3K/month to do this work.

Would it make sense to start with a 30-day trial at 50% off?
```

**Objection: "Need to think about it"**

```
Totally fair! 

What specific concerns do you have that I can help clarify?

Is it:
a) Price/budget
b) Technical feasibility  
c) Team adoption
d) Something else?

Happy to jump on a quick call to address any questions.
```

**Objection: "We'll build it ourselves"**

```
That's a great option if you have:
- AI engineers on staff ($150K+/year salary)
- 3-6 months development time
- Ongoing maintenance costs

Most companies find it's faster and cheaper to use a proven solution.

But I respect either path - what timeline were you thinking?
