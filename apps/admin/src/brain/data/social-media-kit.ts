    `🧵 Thread: How I'm building 4 products as a solo founder from Vietnam

This is my story 👇`,

    `1/ I quit my job 6 months ago to go all-in on building products.

No investors. No team. Just me, coffee, and way too many browser tabs open.

Here's what I've learned so far...`,

    `2/ My stack:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript
• Mobile: Flutter
• Backend: Node.js + Supabase
• AI: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini

Why these? Speed. I can ship features in hours, not weeks.`,

    `3/ Product #1: SABO Arena 🎱

A tournament management app for billiard clubs.

Why? I own a billiard club. I felt the pain. I built the solution.

Status: In production with real users!`,

    `4/ Product #2: LongSang Forge 🔨

Marketing automation for solo founders.

AI-powered content generation, scheduling, and analytics.

Status: Beta testing`,

    `5/ The hardest part? Context switching.

Some days I'm a:
• Developer at 6am
• Customer support at 10am
• Designer at 2pm
• Marketer at 5pm

Solo founder life is chaos. Beautiful chaos.`,

    `6/ My goals for Year 1:

💰 $132,000 ARR total across all products
📈 1,000+ paying customers
🎯 Help solo founders save 10+ hours/week

Let's see if I can do it. Follow along!`,

    `7/ If you're also building in public, drop a comment!

I want to connect with other indie hackers.

Let's support each other 🤝

After months of building in stealth, I'm finally going public with my journey as a solo founder.

I'm building 4 products simultaneously:

1️⃣ LongSang Forge - Marketing automation for indie hackers
